This is a simple demo of [rubyfx](https://github.com/jbreeden/rubyfx). It is in no way complete. However, is shows the basics of creating a controller with rubyfx, loading a UI built with FXML, and embedded web views (a Codemirror editor and Datatables). The app only supports connecting to postgres databases.
